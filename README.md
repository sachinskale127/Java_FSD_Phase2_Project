# Java_FSD_Phase2_Project

The prototype of the application starts from the frontend, and it can also directly start from the project folder. This portal allows us to do flight management across administrator and provide flight booking facilities across client side which will at the end page goes to the payment portal(dummy). This prototype is built through various webpages (mainly .jsp file) which are interconnected with backend (servlets, database, models).
The implementation is done with the help of Hibernate, maven, Servlet, Java EE, Apache tomcat v8.5 and Eclipse.

##Technologies used in Airline Booking applications
1. Servlets: Servlet technology is used to create a web application (resides at server side and
generates a dynamic web page). Servlet technology is robust and scalable because of java language. Before Servlet, CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripting language was common as a server-side programming language
2. JDBC : JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the database. It is a part of JavaSE (Java Standard Edition). JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database.
A list of popular interfaces of JDBC API are given below:
3. SQL: SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National
Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.
4. JSP: It stands for Java Server Pages. It is a server side technology. It is used for creating web application. It is used to create dynamic web content.
